# Programming-Fundamentals-Project
Programming Fundamentials was my core subjects of 1st semester. In this course I learnt about the basics of programming such as switch cases, loops, if else, libraries etc and Cpp.

# Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is an integral part of our childhood memories. It is a fun game consisting of two players who battle each other using Xs and Os.

## Brief Descrition
Tic-tac-toe is a game where two players X and O fill the hash (#) shaped box (consist of two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines) with their alternate turns. The player who first fills the box with 3Xs or 3Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal manner will win the game. 

In some cases, when none of the players succeeds in filling the boxes horizontally, vertically, or diagonally with 3Xs or 3Os, then the game will be considered to be a draw.

## Methodology
We create a two-player Tic Tac Toe game in C++ language using Array, Function, and True-False condition.

## How to run the code?
To run the code we simply reqiure a Cpp compiler and basic knowledge about Cpp language.
